# 👋 Hi, I’m Joseph Lartey Amanor

👀 I’m interested in software engineering, web development, and using technology to solve real-world problems—especially in education and social impact.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development with a focus on JavaScript, React, and backend technologies like Node.js and Express.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, community tech initiatives, and anything that helps me grow as a developer.
